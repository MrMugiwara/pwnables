# pwnables

These challenges are meant to be run on a server. They are meant to be like a typical CTF pwnable challenge. Target the server and exploit it to spit out a flag.

## Hosting the pwnables

Specific instructions should be given in each challenge directory. Solutions available, but not on this repo ;)
